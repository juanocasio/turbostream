 Hi Charles,
    
 I installed it in my large and grilled some lamb loin chops. I was very impressed with this......it works like a charm!   ......I really like it! “
"I use mine (Elevated Charcoal Grate) all the time and love it! I have a mini that just collects dust now! :-) These things work great and they're extremely well built".

"I received my TurboStream complete kit for Christmas and I am thrilled. The flexibility it offers as to setting up a cook is both clever and simple. For an indirect cook I am finding my charcoal gets hotter faster, taking about 10 minutes off my wait time. It also reduces the amount of charcoal I am using in an indirect cook. The build quality is excellent and it is so simple even a caveman could do it. I am thankful I have the TurboStream system for my Egg. I was a fan of the Egg before but TurboStream makes it even more useful for a variety of cooking styles. Love my TurboStream!"

Dear Charles,
    It was a pleasure meeting you yesterday.  When I got home from work around 6:00,
my husband was trying the products that I purchased.  He was like a kid in a
candy shop.  He loved the fact that our Egg heated up faster and used a lot less
charcoal.  Needless to say, it was a huge hit.  Thanks so much for your time and I
will gladly introduce our customers to your product.  By the way,  I loved the video and
you did a great job explaining how the Turbo Stream works.  I look forward to seeing
what else you have in store for us.
Regards,

I used it last night, Charles, and it worked perfectly! It was nice to be able to lower my lump amount and just cook on one side.
I love it for my smaller cooks and to sear steaks or a tenderloin.  I recommend it for sure!"

“Folks have been asking about the Turbo Stream elevated grill I bought at NGA Eggfest. Well I finally got the need to use it.
It is an awesome addition to the tools line up!
The reason I bought is because I was burning up a bunch of fuel to just make 2 or 3 burgers or a steak or two.
I have to say this is my answer!
It installed easily and came up to grill temp fast. 
For the first time out of the box it gets a big thumbs up from me!”

"The Turbostream elevated grate is awesome! Allows me to use my large for a small cook using less coal, but also get a better sear on these steaks. Excellent new product.""
 “ I cooked wings with the airflow diffuser (plates) last night and I was very impressed. Much better indirect temp control …. less hot spots on the edges”
“Used the diffuser plates again tonight! Absolutely love them!”

Hi,
I received your product today!  I was hesitant to purchase the Elevated Grate as there was not much info about it on the forums.  I am glad I did. I was very impressed with the quality of the product.  This is a solid piece of steel.  The craftsmanship is outstanding.  It was simple to install and worked perfectly.  I was so impressed I wrote up a review on the Egghead forum.  Now I need to try the diffuser!

Thanks!

Thank you very much, James! I feel it's a solid, quality product that makes sense/cents! 
Your comments, as well as your posting on the Egghead Forum are VERY MUCH appreciated!
Mind if I post your  comments on my site's Testimonials page

Charles,
You’re more than welcome.  In fact, I’m still so impressed, I told a person i work with and sent them the info today.  Not often I find a new product and go “AHA”!
I will be purchasing the rest of your line once I get a few extra dollars.  The craftsmanship is fantastic.

From Egghead Forum (8/28/2015):
“I got this new product that makes it a snap for cooking small amounts. That's the way I like it!
The TurboStream is a stainless steel bin for charcoal that sits up at fire ring level and leaves part of the grid for indirect heat.

I put a thick steak on the indirect side and put the lid down.
When it was 115° IT, I took the grid off and put it on the ash-covered coals. I got the great char that I love!
I'm very pleased with this new accessory. It saves time, saves charcoal, and it's just what I needed”.
